\section{Travelling Salesman Problem}
Imagine you are prospective student touring RPI. You have a list of buildings you want to visit.
You have on hand the distance between each pair of buildings. Is it possible to vist each building exactly one?
(can't not teleport). If so, what is the shortest possible distance you will need to travel. We also 
have the added constraint that you start at the parking lot and will need to come back to the parking lot.



As our goal is to find an \emph{efficient} route, we will be satisfied with an approximation. 
Or a series of buidlings to visit that is close the optimal.
